problem!!!! :

    i have a function(arr, randRow, randCol) alters a 2d array with a smaller 2d array and
    returns a dictionary named sector.

    Important keys to this problem are 'origin'
    and 'boundery'.

    'origin' is structured like so: [rowIdx, colIdx]
    and 'boundery' is an integer

    the sector is placed at a random [row][col] in the input array and assigns
    its x,y coords to the output sectors 'origin' key.

    the sectors 'boundery' key is representative of the distance from the origin to
    the edges of a sector. ex: boundery = the sector's 2dArray's length / 2 (rounded)

    consider that the function is a seperate file from the main file
    and is called by a function "generateSectors(num)" in the main
    file.

    when called the function should push the 'origin' and 'boundery'
    of the generated sector to seperate arrays and only place new sectors
    where they wont overlap pre existing sectors.

    after the neww sectors random position is determined check if
    its origins distance from all other sectors origins.
    if any origin pairs have bounderys that overlap attempt to regenerate
    random coords for new sector(repeat this up to ten times before assuming theres
    no space for it and breaking the loop)

SOLVED!!!!
